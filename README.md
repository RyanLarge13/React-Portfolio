# React Portfolio
**This is a React project built with Framer Motion
as an animation library and logic which request data from
the web applications personal API via axios.**

## About
This is my Portfolio website created for employers to view
important skills and traits revolving around my coding knowledge.
The application is a true **SPA**. Using React hooks *useState* and *useEffect* this Single Page Application
is meant to be simple accessibile, and informational.

## Backend
1. Axios 
   - For dynamic data and purposes involving skill development, displaying
backend knowledge, state management & React, axios fetches my ***projects*** and ***blog*** data
from a [Node.js/Express server](https://github.com/RyanLarge13/React-Portfolio-Server) created specifically for this application.

## Frontend
1. Framer Motion
   - Using inline props components and elements are
animated with Framer Motion. The styling and animations are
light & simple.

2. useState & useEffect
   - useState is implemented for each and every view in this project
there is only one page.
      - Cons
         - When viewing blogs a user might be tempted to use the back space
and exit the application
      - Pros
         - Extremely fast website rendering
   - useEffect is used lightly. Only to first fetch data when the
state of the application has changed

## Installation & Execution
***This application was not created for the purpose of sharing code
and pull requests.***

3. Form Validation
   - Basic form validation is implimented on the client 
via my own logic system. Additional server side validation techniques
are taken for furthur security.
